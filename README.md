## Description

This project is my attempt to redesign the GitHub profile to display interesting information and metrics for a GitHub user.

I tried to focus on simplicity and readability in the design. The layout is responsive and reorganizes visual elements based on screen size.

The page is populated using data from the [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest).
